                                  "its iconic appeal is symmetry. Symmetry is the balance and proportion of elements within a structure, "
                                  "and it is an essential concept in the design of classic architecture. At its most basic, symmetry is "
                                  "defined as the equal distribution of weight and force around a center point. In classical architecture, "
                                  "symmetry is achieved by using classical orders such as Doric, Ionic, or Corinthian columns, which are "
                                  "proportioned with specific ratios that ensure visual balance. The orders are used in multiples to create "
                                  "a rhythm and repetition of forms that create visual weight and balance. To achieve symmetry in classical "
                                  "architecture, the overall form of the building is often symmetrical around a central axis or line. "
                                  "The façade of a building typically has a centered entrance, a main section with repeating patterns or "
                                  "forms, and two symmetrical wings. The use of symmetrical balance in classical architecture is not just "
                                  "about creating a visually pleasing structure, but it is also about evoking symbolism and philosophical "
                                  "ideas. For example, in ancient Greek temples, symmetry was used to represent order and balance in the "
                                  "cosmos. In Renaissance architecture, symmetry was used to represent the perfection and harmony of the "
                                  "natural world. When examining classical architecture, one can see the use of symmetry in many iconic "
                                  "landmarks, such as the Parthenon, the Palace of Versailles, and the United States Capitol. "
                                  "The Parthenon in Athens, Greece, is often seen as a masterpiece of classical architecture. It has "
                                  "a symmetrical façade with eight Doric columns on each side of the entrance, creating a sense of balance "
                                  "and harmony. The columns of the Parthenon are also tapered slightly, creating the illusion of greater "
                                  "height as they soar upward towards the sky. The Palace of Versailles in France is another example "
                                  "of how symmetry was used to convey power and balance. Its grand façade features monumental columns, "
                                  "repeating vaults, and a central entrance that leads to a grand staircase. The building's symmetrical "
                                  "proportions are a testament to the skill and craftsmanship of the architects who designed it. "
                                  "In summary, symmetry is an essential concept in classical architecture that creates balance, harmony, "
                                  " and proportion. It is a principle that has been used to represent order, balance, and perfection in the "
